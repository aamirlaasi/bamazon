## Overview

Bamazon is an Amazon-like storefront that allows a customer to order a specific quantity of a product based
on the product ID

## Workflow

1. The first step is to run the bamazonCustomer.js file in the terminal by typing "_node bamazonCustomer.js_"

2. As soon as the bamazonCustomer.js file is run, it will load all the products available in the storefront onto the terminal.

3. The first step is for the user to specify the id of the product they would like to purchase as shown in the image below:

5. After the customer specifies the first two steps, the storefront will calculate the total cost of the purchase and display it in the terminal. The transaction is now complete. The storefront is now ready for the next transaction.
